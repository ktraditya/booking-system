## Testing Recommendations

When creating the Spring Boot project, ensure comprehensive test coverage for:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Login, logout, token refresh
2. **Booking Lifecycle**: Create → Confirm → Check-in → Check-out → Complete
3. **Cancellation Flow**: With and without refund eligibility
4. **Payment Processing**: Various payment methods and refund scenarios
5. **Room Availability**: Complex date range and filter scenarios
6. **Guest Profile**: CRUD operations and preference management
7. **Error Handling**: All validation and business rule violations
8. **Concurrent Bookings**: Race conditions for room availability
9. **Pagination & Filtering**: Edge cases and performance
10. **Reports**: Data accuracy and performance with large datasets

## Database Considerations

Recommended database schema should include:

1. **Core Tables**: Users, Guests, Rooms, Bookings, Payments, Messages
2. **Lookup Tables**: Room amenities, Payment methods, Booking statuses
3. **Audit Tables**: Tracking changes to bookings and payments
4. **Indexes**: On frequently queried fields (dates, status, room numbers)
5. **Constraints**: Foreign keys, unique constraints (email, room number)
6. **Triggers**: For automatic calculations (total price, loyalty points)

## Business Rules to Implement

1. **Booking Rules**:
   - Check-in date must be before check-out date
   - Check-in date must be today or in the future
   - Room must be available for the entire date range
   - Number of guests cannot exceed room capacity
   - Confirmation required before check-in

2. **Cancellation Policy**:
   - Define refund percentages based on days before check-in
   - No refund for cancellations after check-in
   - Full refund for cancellations > 7 days before check-in

3. **Payment Rules**:
   - Minimum deposit required at booking (e.g., 20%)
   - Full payment required before check-in
   - Refund processing within 7-14 business days

4. **Loyalty Program**:
   - Points earned per dollar spent
   - Tier upgrades based on total bookings or points
   - Discounts based on membership tier

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this Swagger specification
2. **Confirm** any additional requirements
3. **Proceed** with Spring Boot project creation
4. **Implement** security with Spring Security + JWT
5. **Database** design and entity mapping with JPA
6. **Service layer** with comprehensive business logic
7. **Controller layer** with proper validation
8. **Exception handling** with custom exception handlers
9. **Testing** with JUnit and MockMvc
10. **Documentation** with Swagger UI integration
