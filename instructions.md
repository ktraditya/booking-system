We are a service provider for large bank. We give a lot of test automation resources to the client . 
As part of the interview process we want to test the candidate's ability to write good quality test cases.
So we give them a simple REST API and ask them to do a simple Kata exercise to automate some test cases for the API.
Imagine a moderately complex REST API with multiple endpoints, request types, and response formats for hotel room booking system.
It will have several API's like :

Booking API (to create a booking, update a booking, delete a booking, get a booking) only admin can update or delete a booking
Message API ( to send a message to the hotel staff) from the user perspective and as admin perspective he should be able to read the messages
Room API (create rooms, to get the list of rooms, get room details, check room availability) both user and admin can access
Authentication API ( to login, logout, refresh token) only admin can login

I want to create a Spring Boot project with the above-mentioned API's
First create a swagger file for the above-mentioned API's
Please wait for my confirmation before proceeding to create the spring boot project.
